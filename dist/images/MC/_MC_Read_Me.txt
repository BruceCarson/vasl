Markers; Custom (MC)

This folder serves as an image repository for images used as custom turn and phase track markers. These markers are located in:

VASL Counters > Other > Map > Custom

To use a Phase Wheel, Turn, or Reinforcement marker, right click on the piece to open its context window. Select sides from the drop down windows. Sides set for one of the components sets it for the other two as well.

To add additional side options, update the CustomSides prototype and the the SideA and SideB layers in the markers. The Phase Wheel SideA and SideB layers are activated differently than the SideA and SideB layers in the Turn and Reinforcement markers. Otherwise they are identical and should be updated that way. It's probably easiest to update the buildfile directly when adding additional sides.

The lower Phase Wheel in the counter window is identical to the the top except alt+ctrl+A and alt+ctrl+B has been manually applied to activate the flip side of the Phase Wheel.
